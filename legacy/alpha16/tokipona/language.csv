OBSOLETE,dsi_xthanks2,2448,"Payment received, thank you Captain.","kama mani li pini pona.  sina pona, jan lawa o."
OBSOLETE,dsi_xthanks3,2448,I've received my share.  Excellent work Captain.,"mi jo e kipisi mani mi.  pali pona, jan lawa o."
OBSOLETE,dsi_part1_callfromrep2,2448,Batches of completed parts may now be submitted to the Andromeda Project through the open marketplace. You will find our buyers ready to release funds for any parts manufactured to specification.,sina ken pana e kulupu pi ijo pini tawa kulupu Antometa kepeken tomo esun.  jan esun li wile pana e mani tan ijo wile pini pona ale.
OBSOLETE,dsi_part1_debrief1,2448,"Fantastic work Captain.  I had high expectations, but the process was even more smooth than I hoped.  We've made ourselves known to the Andromeda Project now, but this is just the beginning.","pali pona, jan lawa o.  mi pilin pona la nasin li pona mute.  kulupu Antometa li sona e mi lon tenpo ni.  taso ni li tenpo open taso."
OBSOLETE,dsi_part2_introcall1,2448,"Welcome back Captain.  I've been taking a look at the schematics published by the Andromeda Project, and the next phase is going to need a huge upgrade to our facilities.","kama sin pona, jan lawa o.  mi lukin e sitelen Antometa pi nasin pali.  tenpo kama li wile e kama suli wawa lon tomo pali."
OBSOLETE,dsi_part2_introcall4,2448,"The first part is a Stargate Actuator.  This is something we can manufacture in our existing factory station, although it's a more complex production chain.  There won't be nearly enough resources available in the marketplace, so we'll have to mine the local belt for minerals.",nanpa wan li ilo open pi lupa mun.  mi ken pali e ni kepeken kulupu ilo lon.  taso nasin li ike mute.  esun li jo ala e ijo mute la mi wile alasa kiwen lon kulupu kiwen mun poka.
OBSOLETE,dsi_part2_actuatorsintro5,2448,"One last thing Captain.  I'm sure you've noticed, we aren't exactly surrounded by asteroids here.  I suggest you pair the station up with one of your FTL capable vessels, and jump them both to a suitable mining location.  You can leave the station there to do its work.","ijo pini wan taso, jan lawa o.  ken la sina sona tan lukin: kiwen mun li weka mute lon poka.  mi pilin e ni: o kulupu e tomo pali e ilo tawa pi tawa suli.  o tawa suli e kulupu tawa ma pona pi alasa kiwen.  o awen e tomo pali lon ma ni tan pali ona."
OBSOLETE,dsi_part2_introcall9,2448,"Time is now of the essence Captain.  All three parts need to be produced, and I'm in more of a hurry than you may realise.  Keep me informed!","pona tenpo li suli, jan lawa o.  ijo wile tu wan ale li wile pali.  sina sona ala sona la mi jo ala e tenpo mute.  o pana e sona tawa mi lon nasin pali!"
OBSOLETE,dsi_part2_resinintro5,2448,"You'll need all of that equipment to get started.  I'd recommend Collectors, Refineries, and Factories, four each at least.  You'll also want Storage Tanks to buffer the intermediate products, and an upgrade to the Power Grid.","wile open pali la sina wile e ilo ni ale.  mi pilin e ni: tu tu anu mute la o jo e ilo alasa kon, e ilo pi pali pona, e ilo pali.  kin la o jo e poki lon nasin, e kama suli pi pana wawa."
OBSOLETE,dsi_part2_isotopesintro3,2448,"The final stage is to install a Loader or two, and set them to 'UNLOAD'.  This will instruct your crew to barrel up the stable isotopes and store them in the cargo hold so you can easily sell them on the marketplace.",nasin pali la pini li ni: wan anu tu la o pana e ilo tawa moku wawa.  o lawa e ilo tawa nasin 'WEKA'.  ni la jan li poki e kiwen awen pi tawa suli.  jan li pana e poki tawa ma awen lon tomo jo.  ni la sina ken esun e ona lon tomo esun.
OBSOLETE,dsi_part2_firstpartcomplete,2448,"Excellent work Captain.  On time and to specification, as usual.  The Andromeda Project have enough of that item now, so you may as well stop production and save the energy and materials.","pali pona, jan lawa o.  pona tenpo en pona pi nasin pali.  kulupu Antometa li jo e mute pona pi ijo ni lon tenpo ni la, o pini e pali ni.  sina wile ala weka ike e wawa e ijo."
OBSOLETE,dsi_part2_thirdpartcomplete1,2448,"We are all done Captain.  That was an incredible display of industrialised power.  There's nobody even close to us in the marketplace, and we basically are the Andromeda Project.  They need us now.","pini, jan lawa o.  sina pana lukin e pali wawa.  jan pali ala li lon poka lon esun ale.  suli la kulupu pali Antometa li kulupu mi.  ona li wile e mi lon tenpo ni."
OBSOLETE,dsi_part2_thirdpartcomplete3,2448,"You should know that my Doctors continue to bring me bad news.  Each time I talk to them...well, I don't know how long I have left.  This will be my final project.  I just hope I have time to finish it.",o sona e ni: awen la jan misikeke li toki e pakala sijelo kama tawa mi.  ni li pali pini mi.  mi wile taso e ni: mi jo e tenpo pi ken pini.
