OBSOLETE,blackhole_part3_setup3,2448,This has been a long time coming Captain.  I've been working on this rescue for years.  Time dilation effects from the Black Hole mean that only a few hours will have passed for my brother.

OBSOLETE,blackhole_part3_setup4,2448,"Let's run over the plan one last time.  You're going to perform an incredibly short range Hyperspace Hop, and you'll emerge directly on top of my Brother's ship.  Dock with his ship, rescue him and then get out of there.

OBSOLETE,blackhole_part3_stargate1,2448,Greetings Captain.  Good luck with the rescue.  Remember the data onboard Marcus' ship is extremely valuable to us.

OBSOLETE,tiddlets_part2_setup1,2448,"Welcome back Captain! I must say, the corridors at the Institute have been alive with excitement over this wondrous new lifeform.

OBSOLETE,tiddlets_part2_setup6,2448,"We need you to take the tiddlets on a series of specific hyperspace jumps. We will be recording the effect on their reproductive process and on their physiology.

I'll send a replacement FTL drive in the delivery shuttle.","jan lawa o tu e ilo pi tawa suli lili.  mi kama e ona tawa mi kepeken poki tawa.  tu pini pin pali sona la mi wile e ni: sina weka e ilo pi tawa suli lili, li kepeken ilo pi tawa suli nasin.  mi pana e ilo nasin lon poki tawa sama."

OBSOLETE,tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefa2,2448,"I think I can take it from here Captain.  My engineers tell me they'll have the Hop Drive fitted to the farm ship in just a few days.  In fact, we are close to automating the entire Tiddlet Harvest process with this one ship.","mi pilin e ni: mi ken pini e pali lon tenpo ni, jan lawa o.  jan pali mi li toki e ni tawa mi: tenpo kama poka la ona li pini pana e ilo pi tawa suli lili lon tomo mama Sipa.  ni li wile taso e tenpo suno pi nanpa lili.  lon la, poka la mi lawa ilo e nasin mama Sipa ale kepeken ilo tawa wan taso."
