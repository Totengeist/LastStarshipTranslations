scenario_funds                          FUNDS
scenario_praxis                         A tiny and fast science vessel with all necessary equipment for interstellar adventure, and provisioned with enough supplies for a small crew.
scenario_sleek                          A more complex setup. A large and capable ship with plenty of room for upgrades, but with a heavier and slower hull.
scenario_innershapes                    Another large vessel well suited to combat and dangerous operations.  The forward hull is encased in heavy armour, making the ship much tougher, but also slower and less maneuverable.
scenario_largelogistics                 A modular and easily expanded ship design, ideal for interstellar logistics and mining operations. With cabin space for over 50 crew or passengers.
scenario_carrierfrigate                 A huge community fuselage built by Zion - perfect for any career the Captain desires. The ship benefits from a huge cabin capacity, but is very slow and heavy.
scenario_procyoncruiser                 A community ship built by Orion Industries - a perfect balance of form and function. Decent cabin space and room for equipment, but small and light enough to be fast and nimble.
scenario_shipyard                       The absolute minimum ship fuselage, but you are docked at a fully operational Shipyard with a generous starting budget to build whatever ship you want from scratch.
scenario_industry                       The Stargate Project demands your help! Industry and Automation take centre stage as you manufacture parts for a megaproject stargate to the Andromeda Galaxy.
scenario_crabclaw                       A truly massive ship designed with heavy industry, science and logistics in mind.  Big, slow, and heavy - requiring a massive power grid and engine array.

mission_tiddlets_title                  The trouble with Tiddlets
mission_tiddlets_description1           We need a transport vessel to ferry a litter of lovable, rare live animals to a sanctuary, many jumps away.
mission_tiddlets_description2           The animals aren't dangerous, but they do have some special requirements that must be closely followed or they will not survive the journey.
mission_tiddlets_description3           We will pay $*X if the entire litter is delivered safely.
mission_tiddlets_accepted               Excellent. We are sending a shuttle to you now.
mission_tiddlets_accepted1              Thank you very much for helping us with these unique creatures. If I'm honest, we have struggled to find a captain who was willing to undertake this mission.
mission_tiddlets_accepted2              We have left you with a litter of eight female Tiddlets, along with some comfortable crates for them to sleep in.
mission_tiddlets_accepted3              Please take very good care of them! 
mission_tiddlets_delivered              We have delivered *X out of 8 Tiddlets.
mission_tiddlets_alldelivered1          All 8 Tiddlets have been delivered.
mission_tiddlets_alldelivered2          Now, there is one crucial detail you must adhere to, in order to safely transport these Tiddlets.
mission_tiddlets_alldelivered3          They can survive up to *X seconds in hyperspace safely, but anything beyond that risks them dying of shock.
mission_tiddlets_alldelivered4          Please be very careful when choosing your hyperspace route.
mission_tiddlets_stillalive             Tiddlets still alive : *X

mission_tiddlets_reproduction1          Oh my goodness! We were certain all 8 were female, but clearly we made a mistake.
mission_tiddlets_reproduction2          We would suggest you separate them, but tiddlets reproduce telepathically, and only ever during hyperspace travel.
mission_tiddlets_shock                  Oh my goodness!! There are so many of them!
mission_tiddlets_payment                We have safely received *X out of 8 Tiddlets - Payment due $*Y

mission_tiddlets_extrareward2           We have sent you a couple of prototype Long Range Hyperspace Sensors. They are much more sensitive than the standard model. We hope you find them useful.
mission_tiddlets_notenough              But we trusted you to look after their safety. You've let us down.
mission_tiddlets_failure                What the hell happened? We trusted you with those Tiddlets and you let us down!

wolf_part1_intro1                       My name is Commander Harken, and I'm the Chief of Private Security for the sector.
wolf_part1_intro2                       You have found the remains of the Interstellar Prospector. Please bring its Black Box Flight Recorder to me, and I will explain more.
wolf_part1_intro3                       In order to collect the Flight Recorder you will need Drones, launched from a Drone Bay on your ship.  If you don't already have this equipment, you'll need to buy at least one DRONE BAY, and at least one LOGISTICS DRONE, from any colony or shipyard.

wolf_part1_setupcall1                   Thank you for returning the flight recorder, Captain.
wolf_part1_setupcall1b                  We are in the grip of a major crisis.  Commercial vessels laden with valuable cargo are being targeted and destroyed.  These vessels are under our protection - but often lack any serious defenses, and barely have a chance to send out a distress call before they are plundered.  This is a calculated assault on the free market trade and industry within this sector, and cannot be allowed to continue.
wolf_part1_setupcall2                   I'm sending you the coordinates of two more stricken vessels, pinpointing their last known locations before they went dark.  We need you to travel to the wreckage of each of these ships, and collect whatever evidence you can.
wolf_part1_setupcall3                   The primary objective is the safe recovery of their Black Box Flight Recorders, which will contain a log of their final moments.
wolf_part1_setupcall4                   Here are the co-ordinates of the two shipwrecks we need you to visit.
wolf_part1_setupcall5                   The fourth vessel to be targeted managed to send out a distress call. Local security forces responded too late, and found nothing but the destroyed fuselage with a presumed loss of all crew.
wolf_part1_setupcall5b                  This is the only image they managed to send, before their transmission went dead.
wolf_part1_setupcall6                   The wreckage - which is the forensic evidence of their fate - was collected and taken back to System S*X, where it's currently sitting in storage.  We need you to send a ship to collect the wreckage, and bring it to us along with the recovered black box modules.
wolf_part1_setupcall7                   Bring all the recovered wreckage and the black box flight recorders back to me for analysis on board my ship The Vanguard, to complete the contract.

wolf_part1_dronehint                    Your ship will need a drone bay and drones to collect the flight recorder.

wolf_part1_completion1                  We've analysed the black box recordings and the evidence is already pretty clear.  There's a pirate vessel out there somewhere, preying on high value commercial vessels.  They wait in silence, until the ship is alone, isolated, and defenseless.  They come out of nowhere and attack without warning, and before anybody can respond they've destroyed the ship and looted the cargo.
wolf_part1_completion2                  Most likely to be sold for vast profits to the Stargate Project - who don't seem keen to ask questions.
wolf_part1_completion3                  So far they haven't left a single living witness. But the sensor data tells the full story. We've manged to extract another sensor image of the attacker.
wolf_part1_completion4                  It's another grainy photograph, but it's all we have to go on.  This is without doubt the vessel responsible for all this death and destruction.
wolf_part1_completion5                  We need to find a way to track them down, and destroy them.  We will be in touch soon, Captain.
wolf_part1_completion6                  In the mean time, we suggest you tend to your ships. If you've taken damage, you can repair the hull at any SHIPYARD. Use the funds we've sent to upgrade your defenses.

wolf_part2_advertisement                Captain. We're ready to continue our hunt for the pirate vessel. Please meet me at the marked location.

wolf_part2_objective_visitharken        Travel to Commander Harken

wolf_part2_setup1                       Thank you for coming, Captain.
wolf_part2_setup2                       We have been attempting to track the pirate vessel down, but to no avail. We keep arriving at the scene to find destroyed ships with no trace of the pirates. We need you to-

wolf_part2_distress1                    This is Captain Amelia Ryker of the UMC vessel Orion Sentinel.  We are under attack!  They appeared out of nowhere and fired on us without warning, and won't respond to any of my communications.
wolf_part2_distress2                    I'm trying to hold them off, but I need help.  My engines are damaged.  Ships systems have failed.  Please hurry, I have 40 crew onboard!

wolf_part2_setup3                       This is now an urgent humanitarian rescue situation. If we respond quickly enough, we may just be lucky and find a crew we can rescue.
wolf_part2_setup4                       You'll need to acquire at least four Manoeuvring thrusters to dock with Captain Ryker's ship.
wolf_part2_setup5                       Time is running out.  Send a ship to the Orion Sentinel and provide whatever aid you can, before it's too late.

wolf_part2_objective_thrusters          Fit four manoeuvering thrusters to your vessel [*X/4]
wolf_part2_objective_rescue             Rescue the crew of the UMC Orion Sentinel [*X/40]

wolf_part2_inperson_distress1           Captain, thank goodness you're here! Help us!
wolf_part2_inperson_distress2           We won't last much longer.

wolf_part2_inperson_distress3           It looks like they turned and ran when they saw you arrive, Captain.  But my ship is on the brink. The Reactor won't hold out much longer.
wolf_part2_inperson_distress4           To rescue my crew you'll need to get close and initiate docking procedures. Use your manoeuvering thrusters to align your docking port with ours, in TACTICAL mode.
wolf_part2_inperson_distress5           I'll get the crew ready to evacuate. Please hurry!

wolf_part2_objective_dock               Dock with the UMC Orion Sentinel

wolf_part2_inperson_distress6           The Reactor is reaching critical levels, Captain.  I can't stop it from overloading.
wolf_part2_inperson_distress7           I'll try and buy you a few more seconds, but it's going to go critical any moment.  Get to a safe distance as soon as you can, Captain.  Save my crew!

wolf_part2_objective_escape             Get to a safe distance before the Orion Sentinel explodes

wolf_part2_dropoff1                     Well done, Captain.  Your intervention prevented a further loss of life.  And now we know the pirate vessel is crewed by cowards, a fact that we intend to use to our advantage.
wolf_part2_dropoff2                     In the mean time, take the survivors to the nearest shipyard or colony and drop them off there to close the contract.

wolf_part2_debrief1                     I appreciate your speed in rescuing the crew of the Orion Sentinel, Captain.
wolf_part2_debrief2                     Regrettably I must inform you Captain Ryker does not appear to be among the survivors.  Her sacrifice will be remembered.
wolf_part2_debrief3                     We don't know when or where the pirate vessel will strike again. But we must be prepared.  The more we analyse their attacks, the more obvious the pattern becomes.
wolf_part2_debrief4                     Thank you, Captain.  Protect your fleet, and wait for our call.

blackhole_character_julian              Dr. Julian Martinez

blackhole_summary                       Help Dr. Martinez rescue his brother.

blackhole_objective_visitjulian         Travel to Black Hole Qz247

blackhole_part1_intro1                  Greetings Captain. My name is Dr. Martinez and I'm reaching out to ask for your help.
blackhole_part1_intro2                  For years now my brother and I have been studying the high energy particle emissions in orbit of the black hole you can see behind us.  Its official designation is Qz247 - the collapsed remnants of a star that lived a couple of billion years ago.
blackhole_part1_intro3                  An accident with our equipment has left my brother in dire need of a rescue, and I need your help.

blackhole_part1_setup2                  Thank you for offering your services, Captain.
blackhole_part1_setup3                  The Stargate project funded our research from the beginning.  They buy all the data we can collect, and the closer we travel to the event horizon, the more data our sensors receive. Every mission, we'd push ourselves to go closer.
blackhole_part1_setup4                  The last time, we pushed it too far.  My brother Marcus took the sensor ship and flew closer than we've ever been before.  Right to the edge.  Closer than anyone has ever been.
blackhole_part1_setup5                  I've lost all contact, and he's been down there for a long time now.  He's still showing on the sensors, and his ship is still intact.  The gravitational forces and time dilation will be extreme.  But with your help, we're going to rescue him.
blackhole_part1_setup6                  There's only one way to get to him without falling into the black hole ourselves.  We're going to have to do an extremely short range HYPERSPACE HOP.
blackhole_part1_setup6b                 Using a modified FTL Drive you'll do one hyperspace hop toward the black hole, rescue my brother Marcus, then turn around and hop right out.  It will be dangerous, but it's the only way to avoid being dragged in ourselves.
blackhole_part1_setup7                  I need materials to synthesise the resources we need.  You can help me with this, while I work on the calculations. I'll need Hyperspace Isotopes - you should be able to collect them easily enough, but you'll need to acquire a Hyperspace Scoop first.
blackhole_part1_setup7b                 You'll then need to use a Loader to start unloading the isotopes into containers.
blackhole_part1_setup8                  I'm building the Hyperspace FTL drive that will allow you to perform the hop.  It's going to need some modifications.  I'll need you to manufacture some parts for me. I know you have manufacturing facilities near the Stargate project.  You should be able to make these parts for me without too much trouble.
blackhole_part1_setup9                  Bring those materials back to me, and we can move onto phase 2.

blackhole_objective_scoop               Acquire a Hyperspace Scoop
blackhole_objective_isotopes            Collect Hyperspace Isotopes [*X/*Y]
blackhole_objective_containers          Unload the Hyperspace Isotopes into Containers [*X/*Y]. *Z Containers used
blackhole_objective_modulators          Manufacture Hyperspace Modulators [*X/*Y]

blackhole_part1_hintisotopes1           Looks like you have a Hyperspace Scoop!  You can use this to gather the Hyperspace Isotopes I need.
blackhole_part1_hintisotopes2           You'll need to install the Scoop facing forward on the front of your ship, then connect its pipe output to a storage tank.
blackhole_part1_hintisotopes3           The Scoop works only when you are in hyperspace. So you'll need to gather the isotopes over a few FTL jumps.

blackhole_part1_hintunloading1          You've collected some Hyperspace Isotopes in a tank! You'll need to pump them into Containers so we can easily move them between ships.
blackhole_part1_hintunloading2          Buy a LOADER from any trade post and install it near your Hyperspace Isotope tanks. Connect the pipes, and set the loader to 'UNLOAD'.
blackhole_part1_hintunloading3          You should also designate some storage space for the Isotope containers.

blackhole_part1_return1                 You've gathered the materials I need! Bring them back to me at Qz247 to complete the contract.
blackhole_part1_sendingshuttle          I'm sending a shuttle to you now, Captain. Get your crew to load the Hyperspace Isotopes for me.
blackhole_part1_completion1             Thank you, Captain. I now have what I need to modify this FTL drive for the Short Range Hop.
blackhole_part1_completion2             It's going to take me some time to prepare the calculations.  Leave things to me and I'll call you when we're ready for the next phase.

blackhole_character_stargate            Andromeda Project LLC

blackhole_part2_intro1                  Captain.  My modifications to the FTL Drive are now complete.  We are ready now for phase 2 of my brother's rescue.
blackhole_part2_intro2                  Please come and see me and I'll explain what I need from you.

blackhole_part2_setup1                  Captain. Thanks for coming.
blackhole_part2_setup2                  I've completed work on the modified FTL drive, using those radioactive hyperspace isotopes you provided.
blackhole_part2_setup3                  With this FTL drive you'll be capable of performing an extremely short range FTL Hop in close proximity to the black hole.  You'll emerge directly on top of my twin brother's ship, and perform the rescue.
blackhole_part2_setup4                  You'll need to make two jumps - one in and one out.  I've checked and double checked the calculations.  I'll need your help to make two FTL charges that work with the modified FTL Hop Drive.

blackhole_part2_setup5                  I'll need quite a lot of Tilium Crystals for the FTL charges.  Tilium ore can be mined from just about any asteroid belt in the system - but you will need a Mining Laser to do it, and Drones to collect the mineral.
blackhole_part2_setup6                  You'll then need a Smelter to process the ore into Tilium Crystals.  I have most of the equipment you'll need here.  If you dock with my ship I can send it over.

blackhole_part2_objective_dock          Dock with Julian Martinez
blackhole_part2_objective_lasers        Receive 2x Mining Lasers
blackhole_part2_objective_drones        Receive Logistics Drone
blackhole_part2_objective_dronebay      Receive Drone Bay
blackhole_part2_objective_smelter       Receive 1x Smelter

blackhole_part2_setup7                  Take those Mining Lasers and the drones and find an asteroid belt with some Tilium deposits.  Point the mining lasers at the Tilium and use the drones to collect the mineral.
blackhole_part2_setup8                  Once you've mined the resource you'll need to refine it into Tilium Crystals using the Smelter I've provided.

blackhole_part2_objective_totilium      Travel to an asteroid belt with Tilium deposits
blackhole_part2_objective_mine          Mine Tilium Ore [*X/*Y]
blackhole_part2_objective_refine        Refine Tilium Crystals [*X/*Y]
blackhole_part2_objective_return        Return the Tilium Crystals to Dr. Martinez [*X/*Y]

blackhole_part2_return1                 It looks like you have enough Tilium Crystals.  Bring the Tilium Crystals back to me to close the contract.
blackhole_part2_return2                 I'll send the shuttle to collect the Tilium Crystals. Thank you, Captain!

blackhole_part2_finished1               Excellent work, Captain.  I'll begin synthesising the FTL charges immediately.  It will take me a little while.
blackhole_part2_finished2               I know the Stargate Project have been in touch and I know they want their data.  I get that, but let's remember the priority is safely recovering my brother.  Sometimes they take people for granted.
blackhole_part2_finished3               I'll contact you when I'm ready to begin the rescue.

blackhole_part2_stargate0               Greetings, Captain.  I'm a representative of the Stargate Project.
blackhole_part2_stargate1               We heard about your involvement with the Martinez rescue mission and we wanted to offer our support.  The twins have been hugely important to the project from the beginning, and the data they have provided has enabled many of our biggest advancements.
blackhole_part2_stargate2               When the accident occurred, the younger twin Marcus was collecting vital data on black hole Qz247.  Data that is simply impossible to acquire by any other means.  Data that we need to complete the Stargate.
blackhole_part2_stargate3               Their entire operation is funded by us. So I'm sure you believe us when we say that their safe rescue is very important to us - but just as important is the recovery of the data that remains trapped on Marcus' stricken vessel.
blackhole_part2_stargate4               We see no reason why you can't rescue both Marcus and the critical science data at the same time. If you can recover our data during the rescue, we will pay a substantial bonus.
blackhole_part2_stargate5               Think it over.  We'll be in touch.

blackhole_part3_advert1                 It's time, Captain. I have everything prepared.  With your help, I can finally rescue my brother.

blackhole_part3_setup1                  Everything is ready, Captain.  I've produced the Hyperspace Modulators and the FTL fuel is already loaded.
blackhole_part3_setup2                  You'll be performing the rescue using my ship, using my modified FTL drive that is already installed onboard. You can take control of my ship when you are ready to begin the rescue.
blackhole_part3_setup3                  This has been a long time coming, Captain.  I've been working on this rescue for years.  Time dilation effects from the Black Hole mean that only a few hours will have passed for my brother.  It will be a surprise to him just how much time has passed when you bring him out.
blackhole_part3_setup4                  Let's run over the plan one last time.  You're going to perform an incredibly short range Hyperspace Hop, and you'll emerge directly on top of my brother's ship.  Dock with his ship, rescue him and then get out of there.  Hop in, Rescue, Hop out.
blackhole_part3_setup5                  Once you take control of my ship, you'll find the location of Marcus' ship programmed into your Sector Map.  You will be jumping directly toward the black hole.  You should expect turbulance.
blackhole_part3_setup6                  You won't have long.  Be as quick as you can and jump out of there when you're done.
blackhole_part3_setup7                  Good luck, Captain. I'll see you on the other side.

blackhole_part3_stargate1               Greetings, Captain.  Good luck with the rescue.  Remember the data onboard Marcus' ship is extremely valuable to us.  You'll need Marcus to transmit the data from his console before you can complete the rescue.
blackhole_part3_stargate2               Losing that data will set the Stargate project back years.

blackhole_part3_marcus1                 I was beginning to think you wouldn't be coming!  I've been down here for hours!
blackhole_part3_marcus2                 Dock your ship with mine, Captain, and tell me when you're ready for me to come on board.  Please hurry!
blackhole_part3_marcusdata1             The Stargate data?  I can send that, Captain, but you'll have to give me a few minutes to access the data and set up the transmission.
blackhole_part3_marcusdata2             Damn it Captain, I don't have time for that!  I don't know how much longer the ship is going to survive like this.  I'll do my best, but you'd better be ready.
blackhole_part3_marcuswarning1          My ship is falling apart from the gravitional forces, Captain.  I've sent the data that I can.  Please hurry and get me off this ship!
blackhole_part3_marcuswarning2          The reactor containment has failed, Captain.  The cabin is being flooded with radiation.  You have to get me out of here!

blackhole_part3_finalscene2             What took you so long? I was down there for hours!
blackhole_part3_finalscene3             Wait, how long has it been?
blackhole_part3_finalscene4             You were so close to the event horizon. The temporal distortion was huge.  I've been working on your rescue for a long time Marcus.
blackhole_part3_finalscene5             How long?
blackhole_part3_finalscene6             You've been down there for 10 years.
blackhole_part3_finalscene7             ...!

blackhole_part3_outcomea1               I'm just glad you're safe.
blackhole_part3_outcomea2               Thank you so much, Captain. I couldn't have succeeded without your help. I'm so grateful you took my call and were here for us when we needed you.
blackhole_part3_outcomea3               Here's your payment, and a little bonus.

blackhole_part3_outcomeb1               It was really close.  I can't believe the risk the Captain made you take for that data.  You could easily have been killed.
blackhole_part3_outcomeb2               Captain, I spent the best part of a decade planning this rescue.  I don't appreciate you risking it all at the crucial moment.  I didn't think you'd take that kind of risk with his life.
blackhole_part3_outcomeb3               Thank you for your efforts. The contract is closed.

blackhole_part3_outcomec1                Jesus, Marcus! Get the medical team in here now!
blackhole_part3_outcomec2                What did you do Captain? Why did it take you so long to bring him on board? For what, for some data?
blackhole_part3_outcomec3                His RAD badge is black.  He's been massively irradiated.  How could you do this to us?  I trusted you with this!

blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomea1       We're really disappointed in your choices, Captain.  You've let us down and you've let the whole Stargate Project down, with your incredibly narrow thinking.
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomea2       The data you received is so incomplete that is is rendered virtually useless.  There will be no further bonus from us.
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomeb1       Well done on retrieving some of the data, Captain.  We would have preferred all of it, but we appreciate the rescue was under extreme duress.
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomeb2       Our payment has been scaled accordingly with the volume of data received.
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomec1       Congratulations, Captain, on successfully recovering the science data from the stricken vessel.  This data represents a huge step forward in our understanding of high energy physics, and will hugely accelerate the Stargate Program.
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomec2       We're sorry to hear about the condition of Dr. Marcus Martinez.  In all honesty it is a miracle any rescue was even possible, given the circumstances.
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomec3       Please accept our payment as a sign of our gratitude. We look forward to continuing to work with you.

wolf_part3_setup2                   The UMC Astral Temptress is the bait in our trap.  It's a long haul commercial freighter that was due to be scrapped.  We want you to take the Astral Temptress and travel through the most remote, unprotected locations in the sector.
wolf_part3_setup3                   Look busy, look like you're going somewhere, and bait them out of hiding.  They won't be able to resist such an easy target.
wolf_part3_setup4                   What they won't realise is you'll be carrying several tons of advanced military grade weapon systems, ready to be installed and activated the moment they come in close.
wolf_part3_setup5                   We have one final trick, to buy you some time before the cavalry arrives.  We can reverse the energy field in the ship's FTL drive, and trigger a massive burst of EMP energy.  Enough to disable their FTL and prevent any chance of escape.
wolf_part3_setup6                   Your own ship will lose power too - but in the calamity that follows, you'll have time to fit your weapon systems and prepare for a tough fight.
wolf_part3_setup7                   You'll have to hold them off for a couple of minutes.  My strike force will perform a combat drop virtually on top of you.  Then the tables will turn in our favour.

wolf_part3_objective_dockastral         Dock with the Astral Temptress and crew the ship [*X/*Y]
wolf_part3_objective_jumparound         Jump the Astral Temptress to empty systems until attacked

wolf_part3_setup8                   Remember - the pirate vessel will not show themselves unless the Astral Temptress is alone and unarmed. Good hunting!

wolf_part3_uninstallweapons1        The pirates won't take the bait if they see you armed!
wolf_part3_uninstallweapons2        Uninstall your weapons before jumping again.
wolf_part3_otherships1              There are other ships in this system. The pirates won't attack you unless they see the cargo ship alone!
wolf_part3_otherships2              Try avoiding busy systems with colonies or shipyards.
wolf_part3_episodesystem1           We have received intel that this system is too special to risk luring the pirate here.
wolf_part3_episodesystem2           Try to avoid systems with other important activity.
wolf_part3_emptysystem1             This system is exactly the kind where the pirates might attack.
wolf_part3_emptysystem2             Keep looking busy and travel to another empty system, the pirates must already be on your trail.

wolf_part3_ranaway1                 We almost had them! Your cooperation is crucial for this operation to go smoothly.             
wolf_part3_ranaway2                 The pirates are probably still on your trail thinking you got scared, jump to an empty system to bait them out again.

wolf_part3_emp1                     We've found them! This is our shot.
wolf_part3_emp2                     Charge the EMP weapon and get ready to hit them where it really hurts. Let them come in close. Really close.

wolf_part3_objective_chargeemp      Charge the EMP [*X%]
wolf_part3_action_chargeemp         Charge EMP
wolf_part3_objective_getclose       Let the pirates come close

wolf_part3_emp3                     They're in range! Trigger the EMP from your FTL drive now!

wolf_part3_objective_triggeremp     Trigger the EMP
wolf_part3_action_triggeremp        Trigger EMP

wolf_part3_combat1                  Captain, we're on our way.  Mobilise your crew and install those weapon systems ASAP.
wolf_part3_combat2                  The cavalry are coming.  Hold them off for just a few moments.

wolf_part3_objective_installweapons     Install cannons and connect them to the power grid. [*X/*Y]
wolf_part3_objective_survive            Survive until the strike force arrives
wolf_part3_objective_destroypirate      Destroy the Pirate Ship

wolf_part3_combat3                  Unfortunately it seems we have arrived too late. Your crew's sacrifice will not be forgotten.
wolf_part3_combat4                  Target that explosion and fire!

wolf_part3_debrief1                 Congratulations, Captain. Your performance in the destruction of the Pirate Vessel exceeded all expectations!
wolf_part3_debrief2                 Your skill and bravery have not gone unnoticed. I extend my heartfelt gratitude for your help.
wolf_part3_debrief3                 As a token of appreciation, consider the Astral Temptress now a part of your fleet.
wolf_part3_debrief4                 The ship was due to be scrapped, but we think it may have some years left in its structure yet.
wolf_part3_debrief5                 Farewell, Captain. Your dedication to justice and the safety of our sector will be remembered.

tiddlets_part1_intro2                       Maybe you can help?  I'm looking for creatures that usually live on small isolated asteroids, like the one in this system.
tiddlets_part1_intro3                       If you find anything make sure to tell me.
tiddlets_part1_foundtiddlets1               My gods. You've found them.
tiddlets_part1_foundtiddlets2               Oh god. They're still alive??
tiddlets_part1_foundtiddlets3               Oh jesus. There's two of them!
tiddlets_part1_foundtiddlets4               Captain, you've made an incredible discovery. We have seen these interstellar lifeforms before, on large asteroids deep in uncharted space. But never alive. And you've found a pair! 
tiddlets_part1_foundtiddlets5               We call them the Tiddlets.

tiddlets_part1_setup1                       I should introduce myself. My name is Artemis Toppingbury, and I'm a professor at the Institute of Interstellar Lifeforms.  We've been trying to find a live Tiddlet for years now.
tiddlets_part1_setup2                       This is a massive breakthrough. Bring the Tiddlets on board, carefully, using a Logistics Drone. Once you have them, meet me at the Institute for Interstellar Lifeforms.  We're at Starbase S*X.

tiddlets_part1_sendingshuttle               You managed to bring them back? Amazing! I'll be here in a second.

tiddlets_part1_delivered1                   This is the greatest day of my life!
tiddlets_part1_delivered2                   To be the first to discover and study an entirely new life form. One native to deep space! Think of all we can learn from these little creatures!
tiddlets_part1_delivered3                   I mean, you'll get some credit for finding them, of course. But I've waited my whole life for a moment like this.
tiddlets_part1_setup3                       Now we know where to look, we may be able to find more of them in deep space.
tiddlets_part1_setup4                       The asteroid where you found them has a large iron and aluminium core, with some unusual crystalline structures on the outside.
tiddlets_part1_setup5                       There are similar asteroids within this sector that have been recorded and scanned.  Nobody would bother trying to mine such worthless rocks. They might not have looked too closely.
tiddlets_part1_setup6                       I think it's worth searching there for more of these creatures.
tiddlets_objective_investigate              Investigate asteroid S*X

tiddlets_part1_reproduction2                Oh my goodness, I hope they're ok! What's happening??
tiddlets_part1_reproduction3                Are you kidding me! They've... They've reproduced! We've just witnessed an interstellar life form, spontaneously reproducing!
tiddlets_part1_reproduction4                Oh this is just such incredible news. But what was the condition? Maybe these ones were already fertile and pregnant? Did you see any mating behaviours? I need to do more analysis.
tiddlets_part1_reproduction5                Keep looking Captain. Bring them all back to us when you're done.

tiddlets_part1_death1                       No! Nooooo! Captain what happened? What did you do??
tiddlets_part1_death2                       ... 
tiddlets_part1_death3                       It looks like they died of shock during the hyperspace jump.  Oh goodness, this is such horrible news.  Did any of them survive?
tiddlets_part1_death4                       We'll have to be so careful from now on, Captain. I suggest a maximum hyperspace jump range of *X light years while you have these creatures on board. We can't let any more of them perish this way.

tiddlets_part1_delivered4                   Incredible work, Captain. I can't believe how much we've seen, in such a short period of time.
tiddlets_part1_delivered5                   I've been analysing the onboard sensor data while you've been travelling around.  They don't exhibit any sort of physical mating behaviour, but there is a detectable energy exchange going on, and always between groups of three.
tiddlets_part1_delivered6                   They must be reproducing through some form of telepathy, and only in triplets, and only in hyperspace!  No wonder they're such a rare creature.
tiddlets_part1_delivered7                   These findings will make an incredible research paper, Captain.  I'll be sure to credit you as the pilot who found the first living specimens.  I would offer to name the creatures after you, but they already have a name, so apologies for not being able to honour that tradition.
tiddlets_part1_delivered8                   You'll be getting a call from Dr Swanson very soon.  He funds my lab and all of my research.  I've talked him into directing some of our research grant to you, as a fair reward.

tiddlets_part1_swanson1                     Captain. On behalf of the Institute for Interstellar Life, thank you. A monumental discovery.
tiddlets_part1_swanson2                     Now let's talk real. Scientists like Artemis like to take all the credit, and bask in the glory of their peers. If your name does show up in their research paper, you can bet it will be on the very last page, in the smallest font available.
tiddlets_part1_swanson3                     And despite funding his work for years now, my name will be even lower. It's fine really. We have different aims.  He can have the glory. I'm interested in the breakthroughs. The science that comes from these discoveries. The potential.
tiddlets_part1_swanson4                     Anyway, thank you for your work, Captain. Here's a reward for your efforts.

tiddlets_part2_long                         LONG HOP DISTANCE

tiddlets_part2_advert                       Captain. We're hoping to run some more experiments on the new life form I discovered. The Toppingbury Tiddlet. If you could visit my institute, I have a contract that may be of interest to you.
tiddlets_part2_objective_visitinstitute     Travel to the Institute for Interstellar Lifeforms

tiddlets_part2_setup1                       Welcome back, Captain! I must say, the corridors at the Institute have been alive with excitement over this wondrous new lifeform. My paper has already been provisionally accepted into all the top nature journals, which makes me so proud.
tiddlets_part2_setup2                       The word on the grapevine is that the Nobel prize committee may be looking at our work.
tiddlets_part2_setup3                       Exactly. So we must continue this important research. We have a great deal of data already, but we need to take some more measurements and refine some of our estimates. We are particularly interested in their reproductive process.
tiddlets_part2_setup4                       We're going to send you a batch of Toppingbury Tiddlets, and we want you to run a series of tests on them under Hyperspace conditions.
tiddlets_part2_setup5                       We're also sending you a pair of specially modified science stations, with a sensor attuned to their telepathic reproductive process. I wrote the firmware myself. We will be able to see deep into their minds when this magical process takes place.

tiddlets_part2_objective_receivetiddlets    Receive [*X/*Y] Tiddlets
tiddlets_part2_objective_receivesensors     Receive [*X/*Y] Telepathic Sensor Stations

tiddlets_part2_setup6                       We need you to take the tiddlets on a series of specific hyperspace jumps. We will be recording the effect on their reproductive process and on their physiology. All... well, most of these experiments can be done hopefully without any harm coming to the creatures.
tiddlets_part2_setup7                       We need to zero in on exactly how long the Tiddlets can survive in hyperspace. This will regrettably require you to jump beyond the safe distance, and to record the effect on their telepathic process. Some of the Tiddlets may be lost in the process of this experiment.
tiddlets_part2_setup8                       That does make me quite uncomfortable.
tiddlets_part2_setup9                       But with your permission, we can begin. Install the new sensors first, Captain. And be sure to stock up on FTL fuel if you need to. Three or four jumps ought to be enough.

tiddlets_part2_objective_installsensors     Install Sensor Stations [*X/*Y]
tiddlets_part2_objective_ftlcharges         Have at least *X FTL fuel

tiddlets_part2_mediumjumps1                 Let's start simple. A couple of medium range hops should do the trick.
tiddlets_part2_objective_mediumjumps        Perform medium range hops [*X/*Y]
tiddlets_part2_mediumjumps2                 Excellent. The sensor is working nicely and we are receiving science packets. Let's do one more medium range hop to gather some more data.

tiddlets_part2_shortjump1                   *X Tiddlets so far.  This is all working very well, Captain.  Now onto the real science.
tiddlets_part2_shortjump2                   We'd like to see the effect of a very short hop.  We want to know if there is a minimum hyperspace distance, below which their reproductive process simply does not occur.  Make the jump and let's see how they do.
tiddlets_part2_objective_shortjump          Perform a short range hop

tiddlets_part2_finalexperiment1             *X Tiddlets now on board!  Fascinating, Captain.  It appears the Tiddlet reproductive process occurs even at incredibly short hyperspace distances.\nHow do they find the time?
tiddlets_part2_finalexperiment2             I'll hand you over to my colleague for the final experiment.
tiddlets_part2_finalexperiment3             Captain, the Professor has asked me to oversee this phase of the experiment.
tiddlets_part2_finalexperiment4             I need you to make a long range jump. Beyond the safe tiddlet distance.  We need to know what happens to them under the effects of Hyperspace Shock, and this will also help us to calculate that safe distance more accurately.
tiddlets_part2_finalexperiment5             Get into position and make the long range jump.
tiddlets_part2_objective_longjump           Make a jump longer than the Tiddlet safe distance

tiddlets_part2_return1                      *X of the Tiddlets appear to have perished.
tiddlets_part2_return2                      That's such a horrible thing to witness.\nWe can't allow this sort of experiment to be done again, doctor. It's so unethical.
tiddlets_part2_return3                      The sensor data suggests the telepathic mating ritual does begin during the longer jump.  But the telepathic energy induced between them produces so much heat at their core that they ultimately catch fire and burn out from the inside.
tiddlets_part2_return4                      One can only imagine what that must feel like.
tiddlets_part2_return5                      There's something else.  There's a reading showing up on the sensors, deep inside the core of the dead tiddlets.\nBring them all back to me, Captain. I think we've done enough for today.
tiddlets_part2_objective_return1            Return the Tiddlets to the Institute
tiddlets_part2_objective_return2            Return the bodies to the Institute

tiddlets_part2_debrief1                     We've made another interesting discovery!  Our sensors were correct, and it appears some type of tiny crystal has been formed at the core of several of the dead creatures.  Almost like a small diamond.
tiddlets_part2_debrief2                     It must have formed in the final moments of their life. All that telepathic energy, focussed into a lethal feedback loop!  Our lab tells us the crystals aren't like anything they've ever seen before.  Let's get the remaining samples in for analysis.
tiddlets_part2_debrief3                     Thank you, Captain!

tiddlets_part3_advert                       Captain, there have been several developments with the Tiddlet Research Program. We are in need of a competent starship pilot once again.  Please visit us at the Institute for Interstellar lifeforms and I can tell you more.
tiddlets_part3_objective_visitinstitute     Travel to the Institute for Interstellar Lifeforms

tiddlets3_summary                           Assist the Institute with their experiments

tiddlets_part3_setup1                       The work continues, Captain. There is so much more to these Tiddlets than we realised.
tiddlets_part3_setup2                       Regrettably, Professor Toppingbury has been forced to take a leave of absence.  From the stress of his work, you understand.
tiddlets_part3_setup3                       We know how they reproduce now, and we know their limits. During hyperspace travel, 3 of them will telepathically reproduce.
tiddlets_part3_setup4                       We're not quite sure yet how long it takes for their children to grow up. However, we've noticed they hop at exactly the same time their parents do.
tiddlets_part3_setup5                       This isn't important, but I thought you might find it amusing.
tiddlets_part3_setup6                       As you've already seen, they experience hyperspace shock if they've been in hyperspace travel for too long.
tiddlets_part3_setup7                       But the key is in the final stage of their life-cycle.  We know if we expose them to hyperspace shock, their telepathic energies are so strong that a small crystal is formed in their final moments.
tiddlets_part3_setup8                       We've been studying the crystals we've recovered so far.  They resonate in subspace in a way we've never seen before.  Some of the crystals are entangled at the quantum level, and resonate together.  Apply a signal to one and another responds, instantly, across any distance.
tiddlets_part3_setup9                       There are so many potential applications.
tiddlets_part3_setup10                      So, onto business.  There is a scientist by the name of Dr. Julian Martinez in a nearby system. He had a moment of fame recently after a daring rescue of his brother.  He has a ship for sale that we believe will be of some use.
tiddlets_part3_setup11                      Travel to the noble Doctor and buy his ship. He wants a million credits, which is ridiculous.  He thinks his invention is worth that much.  Negotiate with him, knock that price down, and I'll wire the funds directly to him.  If you can improve his offer then I'll pay you 20% of the savings as a bonus.

tiddlets_part3_martinez_a1                  Captain! It's so good to hear from you again.  How have you been?
tiddlets_part3_martinez_a2                  We've been taking some time to recover.  I must admit, I spent so long planning my brother's rescue, I almost don't know what to do with myself.
tiddlets_part3_marcus                       I don't think I had the chance to properly thank you, Captain. You risked your life for us.  And now my twin is ten years older than me! It's taken some getting used to.
tiddlets_part3_martinez_a3                  I've put the rescue ship up for sale. I was asking $1M, but you can have it for half that price if you like.  Thank you, Captain.  You'll always be welcome with us.

tiddlets_part3_swanson_a1                   Incredible work, Captain. I'm not sure how you managed that, but I'm true to my word.  I'll wire the funds to Dr. Martinez, with a sales bonus of $100k for you.  Bring the ship back to the Institute, and let's put it to use.

tiddlets_part3_martinez_b1                  Hello, Captain.  How have you been? Things have been tough here.
tiddlets_part3_martinez_b2                  Marcus has been in and out of hospital since the rescue.  He has burns all over his body, and took quite a serious dose of radiation.
tiddlets_part3_martinez_b3                  Of course, you already know that, because it happened while he was uploading your data.
tiddlets_part3_martinez_b4                  I hope it was worth it for you, Captain.
tiddlets_part3_martinez_b5                  The ship is up for sale.  I can't bear to be on-board any longer.  The price is $1M.  But I suppose you did help to build the hop drive, so I'll let you have it for $800k.

tiddlets_part3_swanson_b1                   Good work, Captain. That's a good price.  I'll send the funds to Dr Martinez.  You've earned a sales bonus of $40k.  Bring the ship back to the Institute, and let's put it to use.

tiddlets_part3_martinez_c1                  Why are you here?
tiddlets_part3_martinez_c2                  Ten years I worked on his rescue.  Ten years.
tiddlets_part3_martinez_c3                  Do you know what it's like to die from radiation poisoning?  No?  I do.  Since your rescue attempt I've watched it happen.  Hair falls out, organ failure rips through the body.  Vomiting.  Sick and blood.  For days on end.
tiddlets_part3_martinez_c4                  They wouldn't even let me near him.
tiddlets_part3_martinez_c5                  You did that to him, Captain.

tiddlets_part3_martinez_c6                  I don't want to talk to you, Captain.  Yes, the ship is for sale.  Take it.  I don't ever want to see that ship, or you, again.  Do not call me again.

tiddlets_part3_swanson_c1                   Very disappointing, Captain.  You'll need to do better if you want to succeed out here.  This ship is costing us an arm and a leg.
tiddlets_part3_swanson_c2                   I'll send the funds to Dr. Martinez now.  Bring the ship back to the Institute, and we can begin work.

tiddlets_part3_martinez_call                Contact Dr. Martinez
tiddlets_part3_martinez_purchase            Buy ship for *X 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_callagain           Contact Dr. Martinez again

tiddlets_part3_swanson_return1              Our plan is simple, Captain.  We found during your excellent field work that the Tiddlets will still reproduce, even with an incredibly short FTL jump.
tiddlets_part3_swanson_return2              The ship you just purchased has a specially modified FTL Hop Drive.  We can use it to make very short jumps and trigger the hyperspace reproductive process among the Tiddlets.
tiddlets_part3_swanson_return3              We want you to pair the Hop Drive ship with our Tiddlet Farm vessel, and activate the short range hop drive.  You won't even need to leave the system.  If our calculations are correct, we should see an instant result.

tiddlets_part3_morehops                     Excellent.  It's working, as I knew it would.  Give us three more hops, Captain.
tiddlets_part3_objective_hops               Perform more Hyperspace hops [*X/3]

tiddlets_part3_batteryfarm                  Yes!  I knew this would work!  We can battery farm the tiddlets, in huge quantities, right here in this system!  Keep going.  We need more!

tiddlets_part3_swanson_random2              More!

tiddlets_part3_brokenhopdrive1              It looks like that last jump fried the hop drive.  Not great, given what we paid for it.
tiddlets_part3_brokenhopdrive2              No matter.  I'm certain my engineers can repair it.  In any case, I want the hop drive to be installed on the farm ship directly.
tiddlets_part3_brokenhopdrive3              Dismantle the Hop Drive, Captain, and I'll send a shuttle to collect it.  I want you to replace the Hop Drive with a conventional FTL drive, for the final part of the experiment.  I'll send a replacement FTL drive in the delivery shuttle.

tiddlets_part3_swanson_finalobjective1      This is it, Captain. We stand on the verge of a massive achievement.  Can you imagine how many crystals we can produce, in just one jump?  There could be hundreds.  The research potentials are staggering.
tiddlets_part3_swanson_finalobjective2      You know what to do, Captain.  A couple of very long jumps ought to be enough.  Bring them all back to me when it's done.

tiddlets_part3_objective_swanson1           Make long range FTL Jumps
tiddlets_part3_objective_swanson2           Deliver Tiddlet bodies to Dr. Swanson

tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalobjective1      Captain, this is wrong.  You know it is.
tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalobjective2      Please don't do this.  These creatures deserve more than to be battery farmed and slaughtered.
tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalobjective3      My clearances have all been revoked.  They've shut me out completely.  It's up to you, but please make the right choice.
tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalobjective4      I'm hiding out in system S*X.  It's where you found the first Tiddlets, near that unusual asteroid.  Bring them here, and be careful not to risk Hyperspace shock.
tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalobjective5      We're going to set them all free.

tiddlets_part3_objective_artemis1           OPTIONAL: Take the Tiddlets to Professor Toppingbury instead

tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalplea1           Captain, please don't do this!

tiddlets_part3_artemis_arrival1             Captain, thank Goodness.  Are they all safe?
tiddlets_part3_artemis_arrival2             Quickly, before they figure out what's happening.  I'll override the remote transceiver on the farm ship.  For a few minutes we'll be able to control it ourselves.
tiddlets_part3_artemis_arrival3             Long enough to put an end to this horror show.  Take the ship over to the asteroid.  Open the docking bay doors.

tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefa1            Well done, Captain.  Everything has worked exactly as I predicted, and we now have an excellent harvest on the farm ship.  More importantly, you've shown the way.
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefa2            I think I can take it from here, Captain.  My engineers tell me they'll have the Hop Drive fitted to the farm ship in just a few days.  In fact, we are close to automating the entire Tiddlet Harvest process with this one ship.
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefa3            I knew we could rely on you, Captain.  Thank you for showing the highest degrees of professionalism.
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefa4            As for the rescue ship, we don't need it anymore.  It was the Hop Drive we wanted.  You can keep it if you want, or sell it.
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefa5            I'll be in touch if your services are required in the future.

tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefb1            Captain, we lost contact with our ship for a second.  Where are you?  You seem to have gone completely off course.
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefb2            My God.  What have you done?
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefb3            Where are they?  Where are my Tiddlets??
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefb4            Mark my words, Captain.  You will bitterly regret crossing me.
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefb5            Grand Larceny, Property Damage, Fraud, Sabotage.  I'll see to it you spend the next decade in space prison for this.  You and that Professor.

tiddlets_part3_artemis_debrief1             You did the right thing, Captain.  That matters, to me at least.
tiddlets_part3_artemis_debrief2             I wouldn't worry too much about the threat.  He knows he's operating completely illegally.  There's no way the charter of deep space life permits this kind of action.
tiddlets_part3_artemis_debrief3             As for the Tiddlets, the Doctor is sure to return and try to capture more.  I'll do my best to keep them safe from him, for as long as I can.
tiddlets_part3_artemis_debrief4             You may as well keep the rescue ship.  You could sell it if you need to raise some funds.
tiddlets_part3_artemis_debrief5             I'll be in touch if I need your help, Captain.

tiddlets_part4_rescue_swanson1              Captain, I don't know what happened. It's the Hop Drive. My engineers told me they tested it fully!
tiddlets_part4_rescue_swanson2              There's something wrong with it. We can't stop jumping. They've replicated... so many times. They're EVERYWHERE!

tiddlets_part4_debrief_swanson1             Thank God.
tiddlets_part4_debrief_swanson2             It looks like the Hop Drive burned through all the jump charges. It's over.

tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis1             I tried to stop him. Tried to warn him.
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis2             Captain, these recent events have made me reconsider my role in all of this. These creatures need our protection. They need somebody to look out for them.

tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_a1           I want to thank you for helping, Captain, when it counted. For doing the right thing. I'll split the remaining grant money I have with you. You deserve it.
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_a2           One last thing.  I couldn't help but notice you've picked up a couple of Tiddlets, along with the scientists you rescued. I wouldn't worry - two is a very safe number.
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_a3           But I'd recommend you never bring a third aboard.  Look after them, Captain. I know you will.

tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_b1           I thought Dr Swanson was my ally. And I thought I could trust you. But you both put money before everything else. I don't know how you can live like that.
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_b2           You've one last chance to make things right. It looks like a couple of Tiddlets found their way onboard with the scientists you rescued. Two is probably safe, but never bring a third aboard.
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_b3           I suggest you look after them from now on, Captain. It won't atone for the things you've done, but it's a start.

rise_part1_briefing3                        I suspect foul play here, Captain. There's no way a ship like the Celestial Hammer would just vanish. Something must have happened, and I'm assuming the worst.

dsi_xwarning1                               Captain, I can see you've sold a batch of Stargate parts, but I've received no corresponding payment.  We agreed to split all revenue 50/50.  This setup is costing me a fortune and I need to start making my return.  Please transfer the funds to my account as soon as possible.
dsi_xwarning2                               Captain, I was sure I'd made our agreement clear.  Don't forget who owns this station, and all the equipment onboard.  50/50 was what we agreed.
dsi_xwarning2_part1                         Captain, I was sure I'd made our agreement clear.  Don't forget who owns this station, and all the equipment onboard.  50/50 was what we agreed.
dsi_xwarning2_part2                         I thought I could trust you.  Pay me the money you owe, immediately, or I will be forced to escalate.
dsi_xwarning3                               Captain, this is your final warning.  You are now willfully withholding sales revenue that is legally mine.  If you don't pay what you owe immediately I will have no choice but to terminate our agreement, seize control of my station, and recover any financial losses directly from you.

dsi_x_canceldeal1                           I'm disappointed, Captain. You're backing out after all the investment I've put into this project?

dsi_part1_advert1                           My name is Alexander James Elistar, and I'm the chairman and founder of A.J.E Industries.  I have a business proposition for you.  If you would be interested in setting up a production facility for me, I believe with some luck and a good deal of hard work we can both make substantial returns.
dsi_part1_advert2                           Please give me a call to discuss the details.

dsi_part1_action_callX                      Call X

dsi_part1_call1                             Captain.  Perhaps you are already aware, but there are big plans underway within this sector.  There are designs to build something... incredible, a transportation system with near infinite range, requiring state of the art manufacturing and industry.
dsi_part1_call2                             A stargate, big enough for our most massive fleets, shuttling humanity between galaxies as if they were nothing but neighbouring stars.  A new multi-galactic era for humanity.
dsi_part1_call3                             In all my years I've never known so much capital to be allocated to one project.
dsi_part1_call4                             There is a golden opportunity here for us, but the barriers to entry are high.  I have the assets, the capital, and the facilities that we need to fulfil the Andromeda Project's massive ambitions.
dsi_part1_call5                             Sadly, my days of running the shop floor in person are long behind me.  I need a floor manager, somebody who will oversee the day to day operations for me.  And my years of experience have taught me to spot talent when I see it.
dsi_part1_call6                             Here is my proposal.  I'll provide the factory station, and the seed capital so you are fully funded.  You'll set up the production facility for me, and oversee day to day operations, manufacturing parts for the Andromeda Project to their specifications.
dsi_part1_call7                             We'll split the profits 50/50.
dsi_part1_call8                             And believe me when I say, there will be plenty to go around.

dsi_part1_objective_callx                   Call Alexander about the production facility
dsi_part1_objective_accept                  Accept Alexander's proposal

dsi_part1_setupcall1                        Wonderful news. I'm very happy you've agreed to partner with me on this. My factory space station is in position nearby, ready for us to use as our base of operations.
dsi_part1_setupcall2                        This is the A.J.E Foundry.  A wonderful industrial facility, perfect for our needs.  I'll just need to provide you with some access codes so you can assume control of the facility.
dsi_part1_setupcall3                        Look at that.  For years I manufactured engines and FTL drives right here, for every fleet that passed through the sector.  It's really fallen into disrepair.
dsi_part1_setupcall4                        Your first job is to send over a skeleton crew, and establish basic power generation and life support.  I had the previous crew box up some of the usable equipment.  You should find the parts you need are already in storage.

dsi_part1_installsmelter1                   We need to tidy up the mess, but nothing needs to be wasted.  We can recycle all of the raw materials found on this station.
dsi_part1_installsmelter2                   There is an industrial smelter among the boxed equipment.  Install it and power it up, then set it to recycling all of the scrap metal.  This will give us an early supply of Metal Ingots.  A critical resource in manufacturing anything.

dsi_part1_setupstorage1                     Efficiency is going to be the key to this facility turning a profit.  Set up a storage zone for scrap metal near to your Smelter, and another for the Metal Ingots that come out.  Our crew will waste a lot less time carrying goods long distances.

dsi_part1_objective_storescrap              Store scrap metal near Smelter [*X/10]

dsi_part1_manufactureframes1                If I could draw your attention to this schematic issued by the Andromeda Project.  You can see it's actually quite a simple part.  This is just a structural framework, onto which they'll build everything else.
dsi_part1_manufactureframes2                We can manufacture these parts in just two stages out of Metal Ingots.  I've left a boxed Fabricator and an Assembly Table on the station.  Set them up next to each other, ideally near to the Metal Ingots.
dsi_part1_manufactureframes3                Once they're installed, set the Fabricator to manufacture Frames, then set the Assembly Table to specialise them into finished Stargate Frames.  It's simple stuff, but eventually we will need a huge throughput.

dsi_part1_objective_setfabricator           Set Fabricator to Frames
dsi_part1_objective_installassemblytab      Install Assembly Table
dsi_part1_objective_setassemblytab          Set Assembly Table to Stargate Frames

dsi_part1_manufactureframes4                They want us to provide an initial batch of 10 Stargate Frames, for certification.  They'll inspect our work and we'll be approved as official partners in the Andromeda Project.
dsi_part1_manufactureframes5                It shouldn't take too long.  If you run out of metal, remember you can recycle more of the ruined equipment around the facility.

dsi_part1_objective_manufactureframes       Manufacture Stargate Frames [*X/10]

dsi_part1_action_deliverframes              Deliver 10 Stargate Frames

dsi_part1_callfromrep1                      This is a message for A.J.E FOUNDRY.  We've received your samples and can report that they have passed comfortably within our engineering tolerances.  You are formally approved as licensed industry partners, and may now manufacture all items in our design manifest.
dsi_part1_callfromrep2                      Batches of completed parts may now be submitted to the Andromeda Project through the open Marketplace. You will find our buyers ready to release funds for any parts manufactured to specification.
dsi_part1_callfromrep3                      Thank you for your endeavours, and good luck.

dsi_part1_openstargatescreen                Excellent.  Let's have a look at the Manifest that he mentioned, and see what is required next.

dsi_part1_phase2_xcall1                     It looks like it's just a bulk order of the part we already provided.  We need to make 200 more Stargate Frames.  We're already manufacturing them, but we'll need to scale up production or else this will take forever.
dsi_part1_phase2_xcall2                     I'm releasing some of the seed money to you.  $600,000 should be enough for you to buy all the equipment we need to scale up.  Remember this isn't a gift.  I still own this station, and all the equipment onboard.
dsi_part1_phase2_xcall3                     I suggest you buy more Smelters, more Fabricators, and more Assembly Tables.  A couple of each at least.  All that equipment will draw more juice, so you'll need to expand the power network with more Reactors and Batteries to cope.  And you'll need more crew to do the work.
dsi_part1_phase2_xcall4                     If you run out of Metal Ingots, you should be able to buy raw materials from the open Marketplace.  You can usually buy more Scrap Metal, but you'll also find Metallic Minerals for sale which can also be smelted into Metal Ingots.

dsi_part1_objective_scaleupproduction       Scale up production
dsi_part1_objective_smeltmetallicminerals   Start smelting Metallic Minerals [*X/200]
dsi_part1_objective_produceframes           Produce 200 Stargate Frames [*X/200]
dsi_part1_objective_sellframes              Sell Stargate Frames [*X/200]

dsi_part1_payx1                             I knew this would be a very profitable endeavour for us.  The Andromeda Project are so desperately in need of reliable manufacturing facilities that they're paying a fortune.
dsi_part1_payx2                             Now, the sales revenue is going to flow through you.  But remember our agreement.  50/50.  I've put a lot of capital in to get us to this point, and I need to start seeing a return.
dsi_part1_payx3                             Every time you sell a batch of parts to the Andromeda Project, you'll owe me half the revenue.  I'd appreciate it if you'd pay promptly.

dsi_part1_debrief1                          Fantastic work, Captain.  I had high expectations, but the process was even more smooth than I hoped.  We've made ourselves known to the Andromeda Project now, but this is just the beginning.
dsi_part1_debrief2                          The later phases of this project will no doubt be much more involved.  But we are perfectly positioned to capitalise on this opportunity.  And there is a lot of opportunity to be had.
dsi_part1_debrief3                          There are individuals behind this mega-project with wealth and resources far beyond my comprehension.  But their ambitions far exceed the capabilities of the other ships and people in this sector.  They are going to need our help.
dsi_part1_debrief4                          We can take a short break, and I'll give you a call when I'm ready to start work on the next phase of the stargate project. You might want to stop some of your equipment in the meantime, we don't want to waste anything!
dsi_part1_debrief5                          Goodbye for now!

dsi_part2_advertisement                     Captain, I think it's time we resumed work on the Stargate contract.  I've had a look ahead and the next phase is a huge step up.  Give me a call when you're ready to continue work.

dsi_part2_action_accept                     Call X

dsi_part2_objective_sellreminder            Sell your manufactured parts to submit them to the Stargate project

dsi_part2_introcall1                        Welcome back, Captain.  I've been taking a look at the schematics published by the Andromeda Project, and the next phase is going to need a huge upgrade to our facilities.
dsi_part2_introcall2                        However, nothing they're asking us to produce is impossible, and I have a strong personal interest in seeing this project completed.  The sooner the better.
dsi_part2_introcall3                        The Andromeda Project have released specifications for three different components.  We need to manufacture large quantities of all three to complete this phase, and each will require a different industrial setup.

dsi_part2_objective_actuators               Manufacture Stargate Actuators [*X/250]
dsi_part2_objective_resin                   Manufacture Stargate Resin [*X/250]
dsi_part2_objective_isotopes                Manufacture Stable Isotopes [*X/100]

dsi_part2_introcall4                        The first part is a Stargate Actuator.  This is something we can manufacture in our existing factory station, although it's a more complex production chain.  There won't be nearly enough resources available in the Marketplace, so we'll have to mine the local belt for minerals.

dsi_part2_objective_takecontrol             Take control of the A.J.E Foundry
dsi_part2_action_takecontrol                Take control of station

dsi_part2_actuatorsintro1                   I propose we expand and upgrade the Station into a mining facility.  If we install Engines we can move to a rich asteroid vein, then Mining Lasers and Logistics Drones will give us the capability to harvest the raw materials we need.
dsi_part2_actuatorsintro2                   The Stargate Actuators are made on the Assembly Table as normal, and they require a Stargate Frame and a Motor. Motors can be made in fabricators.
dsi_part2_actuatorsintro3                   You'll need to mine Metallic Minerals and Copper Minerals, then melt those materials into ingots in an array of Smelters.  You can then fabricate the Motors and Frames, and finally assemble them into Stargate Actuators.
dsi_part2_actuatorsintro4                   I'll release some more of the seed capital to cover the costs of the upgrade, but you can take care of the details.

dsi_part2_objective_installlasers           Install mining lasers
dsi_part2_objective_installdrones           Install logistics drones
dsi_part2_objective_mineminerals            Begin mining metallic minerals [*X/100]

dsi_part2_objective_producemotors           Begin fabricating Motors [*X/100]

dsi_part2_objective_installengines          OPTIONAL: Install engines in the A.J.E Foundry
dsi_part2_introcall6                        The second part is a chemical compound they're calling Stargate Resin.  It's synthesised in a Chemical Lab, but we first need huge volumes of Metreon Gas.  It's found only in deep space nebulas.
dsi_part2_introcall7                        My thinking is to buy a suitable fuselage from a Shipyard, and then convert it into a dedicated gas capture and refining facility.  There's a good ship nearby.  You can buy it on my behalf and then set it up, and we'll drop it off in a rich gas cloud and leave it running.

dsi_part2_objective_buygasfuselage          Buy the Gas Capture fuselage

dsi_part2_introcall8                        The final requirement is a few barrels of Stable Isotopes.  These are easily captured during routine FTL travel.  I think you can take care of this one yourself, but if necessary I can talk you through it.

dsi_part2_action_askaboutisotopes           Ask about Stable Isotopes

dsi_part2_actuatorsintro5                   One last thing, Captain.  I'm sure you've noticed, we aren't exactly surrounded by asteroids here.  I suggest you pair the station up with one of your FTL capable vessels, and jump them both to a suitable mining location.  You can leave the station there to do its work.

dsi_part2_introcall9                        Time is now of the essence, Captain.  All three parts need to be produced, and I'm in more of a hurry than you may realise.  Keep me informed!

dsi_part2_resinintro1                       There is a ship for sale here that's perfect for our gas collection enterprise.  Let's buy it and add it to the fleet.

dsi_part2_resinintro2                       Gas collection is a slow process.  Our aim should be to place this vessel within a dense metreon nebula, slowly absorbing the gas and refining it over time.  Once we're in the nebula we won't be able to easily upgrade the ship, so we'll want to set it up as much as possible in advance.
dsi_part2_resinintro3                       I'll send over more seed money and you can outfit the ship as you see best.

dsi_part2_resinintro4                       The process of making Stargate Resin starts with a Gas Collector bringing in the Metreon Gas.  We then pipe that into a Refinery to produce Refined Metreon, then into a Chemical Lab where the Stargate Resin can be synthesised.
dsi_part2_resinintro5                       You'll need all of that equipment to get started.  I'd recommend Collectors, Refineries, and Chemical Labs, four each at least.  You'll also want Storage Tanks to buffer the intermediate products, and an upgrade to the Power Grid.
dsi_part2_resinintro6                       You may need to shop around a bit, if the local trade post doesn't have everything you need.
dsi_part2_resinintro7                       Once the ship is ready, pair it up with one of your FTL capable vessels, and jump into a nearby nebula to begin the process of gas collection.

dsi_part2_objective_collectgas              Begin collecting Metreon Gas [*X/100]
dsi_part2_objective_refinegas               Begin refining Metreon [*X/100]

dsi_part2_action_buyship                    Buy gas fuselage

dsi_part2_isotopesintro1                    We need to produce 100 Stable Isotopes. This is a chemical compound we must synthesise and deliver in barrels to the Andromeda Project.
dsi_part2_isotopesintro2                    It's not too complex.  It starts with a Hyperspace Scoop, or several ideally, that you can fit to your vessels.  Every time you make an FTL jump you'll collect more as you pass through hyperspace.  You can then pipe those isotopes into a Refinery and convert them into Stable Isotopes.
dsi_part2_isotopesintro3                    The final stage is to install a Loader or two, and set them to 'UNLOAD'.  This will instruct your crew to barrel up the stable isotopes and store them in the cargo hold so you can easily sell them on the Marketplace.

dsi_part2_objective_installscoop            Install Hyperspace Scoop
dsi_part2_objective_collectisotopes         Begin collecting Hyperspace Isotopes [*X/100]
dsi_part2_objective_unloadisotopes          Begin unloading barrels of Stable Isotopes [*X/10]

dsi_part2_firstpartcomplete                 Excellent work, Captain.  On time and to specification, as usual.  The Andromeda Project have enough of that item now, so you may as well stop production and save the energy and materials.

dsi_part2_secondpartcomplete1               I'm sure you've noticed, we're making a small fortune from all of this.  Truth be told, I'm not really doing this for the revenue.  I already have more than I can ever spend.  But I'm running out of time.  The Doctors have made that clear to me.
dsi_part2_secondpartcomplete2               I've been around quite a few years.  I've had my share of success, built my empire, my fortune.  I live a comfortable life.  But I find myself thinking more and more about what I want to do with the time I have left.
dsi_part2_secondpartcomplete3               I just want to be the first at something huge.  The first person to visit another galaxy.  Alexander James Elistar.  That's a name that people would remember.

dsi_part2_thirdpartcomplete1                We are all done, Captain.  That was an incredible display of industrialised power.  There's nobody even close to us in the Marketplace, and we basically are the Andromeda Project.  They need us now.
dsi_part2_thirdpartcomplete2                Let's take another break and I'll contact you when the Andromeda Project releases the manifest for their next phase.
dsi_part2_thirdpartcomplete3                You should know that my Doctors continue to bring me bad news.  Each time I talk to them... well, I don't know how long I have left.  This will be my final project.  I just hope I have time to finish it.

# DSI 2 Scene

dsi_part2_scene_x4                          Captain, I'll take care of this.  My private security are on their way.  I'll keep him talking, but there's no need for bloodshed.
dsi_part2_scene_y4                          The designs were mine.  The patents were mine!  All of this, it's all built on my work.
dsi_part2_scene_x5                          You were compensated for your work Raymond.  You signed the contract.
dsi_part2_scene_y5                          For pennies!  You screwed me, and now it's worth millions!
dsi_part2_scene_y6                          I want my share.  Deal me in.  10% ownership of this new venture of yours.  I'm being reasonable, but the law is on my side.  Don't make me shut you down Alexander.

bravenewsector_part1_x3             I believe this is only the beginning though, the Andromeda Project have made it clear they want to reach a new galaxy, not just a new sector. I'm sure they will be in contact soon about the next steps of the Stargate.
bravenewsector_part1_x4             Thank you Captain, for all your hard work. Goodbye for now.

stargatesectorwarning_harken_1      Captain, the new sector needs to be surveyed before your sector map is populated with systems. We have a full scan underway for the sector, once it's completed more locations will be marked on your map.
stargatesectorwarning_harken_2      In the systems surveyed so far we've found new resources and severe weather systems, which may be just a glimpse into what awaits us in this sector.
stargatesectorwarning_harken_3      Who knows what you may find out here. Be careful, Captain.

bravenewsector_part1_representative1    Greetings Captain. What you've found could prove to be very useful to the Stargate project.
bravenewsector_part1_representative2    Since you've used our Stargate to reach the new sector, we believe it's only fair that you assist us with researching the uses of the new resources.
bravenewsector_part1_representative3    Your co-operation has been paramount in the project's sucess so far, and it must continue until the project is complete.
bravenewsector_part1_representative4    Thank you, Captain. We will be in touch when you have completed your research.

bravenewsector_part1_researchneubidium  Research Neubidium Processing

bravenewsector_part1_representative5    Hello again, Captain.
bravenewsector_part1_representative6    The results of your research are very promising, and we'd like you to send us some refined samples of the new resources.
bravenewsector_part1_representative7    We expect a shipment of Neubidium ingots and the stabilised Zeleon gas.
bravenewsector_part1_representative8    Thank you for your co-operation, Captain.

bravenewsector_part2_summary    Uncover the history of the new sector.

bravenewsector_part2_x1             Hello again Captain, the Andromeda Project is very impressed with the samples you've sent them. They want your work on the Stargate to continue.
bravenewsector_part2_x3             I must warn you, there are rumours that their plan is to take the Stargate fully under their control. They will charge anyone who wants to use it a fortune, preventing any competition and harvesting all the resources in the new galaxy for themselves. They will become more powerful than any entity we have seen before.
bravenewsector_part2_x4             Please don't let that happen Captain. So much of my life and so many of my projects have been done purely for profit, I can't let this become one of them. The Stargate is too important and valuable for our species to be under their control.
bravenewsector_part2_x5             I have installed a back-door that will cause the Stargate to self-destruct if you command it to. You must trigger it if the rumours are true.
bravenewsector_part2_x6             Unfortunately, I've been given some bad news, and I won't be around for much longer. I would like to give you full ownership of the foundry as a thank you for helping me finish this final project.
bravenewsector_part2_x7             It seems we have completed it just in time.
bravenewsector_part2_x8             This is our final call, Captain. I wish you the best of luck. Thank you again, and goodbye.

bravenewsector_part2_harken_1       Captain, our sector scan has found new systems. They contain shipyards that are currently being operated by pirates.
bravenewsector_part2_harken_2       Their exterior wear leads us to believe that they have been here for at least a century. This sector must have been one of mankind's first attempts to colonise outer-space.
bravenewsector_part2_harken_3       There are signs of a massive galactic war in this sector, with derelict ship signals appearing all across our sector map.
bravenewsector_part2_harken_4       The aftermath of the war resulted in pirates gaining control of the sector for themselves. They have since been living here, dormant, surviving from the resources harvested in local asteroid belts and nebulas.
bravenewsector_part2_harken_6       Destroying the fortresses would allow us to set up friendly shipyards and take back control of the sector from the pirates.
bravenewsector_part2_harken_7       Be prepared to be met with heavy resistance if you choose to visit them. I have added their positions to your sector map.
bravenewsector_part2_harken_8       There's a shuttle on the way to L*X with surveying equipment on-board. It will allow you to scan the area around your ship.
bravenewsector_part2_surveywarning  There's a shuttle on the way to L*X with surveying equipment on-board. The equipment can only be used in the new sector, so you'll need to send a ship through the Stargate to start surveying.
bravenewsector_part2_harken_9       The forgotten battlefields of the sector may contain new research opportunities, I'd recommend that you explore any derelict ships you detect.
bravenewsector_part2_harken_10      That's all from me Captain, good luck.

bravenewsector_part3_title      Brave New Sector, Part 3
bravenewsector_part3_summary    Assist the scientist with his research.

bravenewsector_part3_intro_rep1     Hello again, Captain. Congratulations on completing the latest phase of the Stargate project! We are all very impressed by your commitment and dedication.
bravenewsector_part3_intro_rep2     The project has a new task for you. One of our scientists is investigating a new lifeform called tiddlets. 
bravenewsector_part3_intro_rep3     Upon death, a crystal is formed at the core of the tiddlet. This crystal has extraordinary energy density, which is exactly what we need to increase the hyperspace range of the Stargate.
bravenewsector_part3_intro_rep4     The Andromeda Project would love to relentlessly farm these tiddlets, but due to recent accidents they have become a strictly protected species. The scientist you're going to visit is researching how to ethically produce their crystals. He believes the new sector's resources will be a breakthrough for his research.
bravenewsector_part3_intro_rep5     Visit him and provide him a sample of the zeleon.

bravenewsector_part3_artemis_1a     Captain? Is that you? What are you doing here? It's so good to see you!
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_2a     The Andromeda Project have hired me to work on synthesising the tiddlet crystals that we discovered during our research, and I see they've sent you to provide me with the zeleon.
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_3a     I see you're looking after those tiddlets well! A lot has changed since the tiddlet farm explosion. They are a protected species now and harming them is strictly prohibited.
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_4a     A lot has changed since the tiddlet farm explosion. They are a protected species now and harming them is strictly prohibited.

bravenewsector_part3_artemis_1b     Greetings Captain, the Andromeda Project have hired me to work on synthesising crystals produced by a creature I discovered. I've named them tiddlets.
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_2b     Upon death, a crystal is formed at the core of the tiddlet. My job is to find a way to produce these crystals without having to farm any tiddlets in the process.
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_3b     The neubidium and zeleon you discovered could be key to my research.

bravenewsector_part3_artemis_5a     One moment Captain, I've sent a shuttle to receive the resources from you.
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_5b     Unfortunately, it looks like you don't have the resources I need for my experiment, when you have the required amount come back and I'll retrieve them from you.

bravenewsector_part3_artemis_6      Great! That should be all the resources I need. I'll run the experiments and call you back when I'm done.
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_7      Speak to you soon, Captain!

bravenewsector_part3_wait_rep1      Thank you for doing that Captain, Artemis will correspond with you directly from now on.
bravenewsector_part3_wait_rep2      Goodbye for now.

bravenewsector_part3_waitforresults     Wait for Artemis to call you about his experiment

bravenewsector_part3_artemis_results_1  Hello Captain! I have incredible results. Using a highly powered zeleon laser we can charge synthetic crystals made of Neubidium to achieve properties similar to that of the tiddlet crystals.
# bravenewsector_part3_artemis_results_2  The new crystals enable more than just energy density and telepathy, but also teleportation! I would recommend researching this as it might significantly speed up logistics between your ships.
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_results_3  This is a fantastic breakthrough but I must warn you that the laser is incredibly radioactive, and will very quickly kill your crew if you don't correctly contain its radiation.
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_results_4  Come back to my system and I'll send you one of my lasers along with some radiation blockers to keep your crew safe.

bravenewsector_part3_receivecrystal     Receive an Empty Crystal
bravenewsector_part3_receivezeleon      Receive Zeleon Energy Cell

bravenewsector_part3_artemis_results_5  The next step is to research how this all applies to the Stargate. My hypothesis is that we can use the crystal's energy-density properties to enable jumps much farther than the next sector.
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_results_6  Good luck with your research, Captain.
